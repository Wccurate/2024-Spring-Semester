Kaggle: Titanic - Machine Learning From Disaster 

Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview

Overview:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we ask you to USE SPARK SQL TO ANALYZE THE DATASET that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, etc).

Dataset Description:
Variable	Definition	     Key
survival	Survival	     0 = No, 1 = Yes
pclass	    Ticket class	 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
sex	        Sex	
Age	        Age in years	
sibsp	    # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
parch	    # of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
ticket	    Ticket number	
fare	    Passenger fare	
cabin	    Cabin number	
embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

Question:
1.891人当中，共多少人生还？
2.存活/未存活的男女数量及比例
3.不同级别乘客生还人数和占总生还人数的比例
4.按照年龄(1,18]  、(18,35]、 (35,55] 、(55,100]，将乘客划分为未成年人、青年人、中年人和老年人，分析四个群体生还情况
